For all model lovers, I present you models and textures (as well as images) taken from three games - Star Wolves 1, 2 and 3: Civil War. All rights belong to the copyright holders, not to me.

The archive already has both ready-made models and textures to work in your engine (.obj and .png) so do the original ones in case something goes wrong. 
Also inside there is an instruction on how to convert old files to the desired format for your engine, as well as recommended programs.
Good luck!
